Build an Abstract Data Structure

* Ruby provides Arrays and Hashes 
* Other types of data structures include 
    * Graph
        * A set of Objects where some points of the objects are connected
        * Vertices: The point where objects connect
        * Edges: The links that connect vertices
        * Adjacency: Two nodes connected by a edge
        * Path: Folling a connected nodes from one to the other
        * A graph is basically a group of sets of (V, E)”s 
        * Directed Graph: Edges have direction
        * Undirected Graph: Edges don’t have direction
        * Complete Graph: all Vertices are connected to each other 
        * 
	
￼
	V = {a,b,c,d,e}
	E = { ab, ac, bd, cd, de}
	

Basic Operations:

Add Vertex: add a vertex to the graph
Add Edge: Add an edge between two vertices of a graph
Display Vertex: Display a vertex of a graph

	
    * Map
    * Set
    * String
    * Tree
